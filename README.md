## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - JS library

### Continued development

I want to continue to use Tailwind CSS in more projects. I think it is a really cool framework to structure and style HTML all in one place. It also is not opinionated in terms of the design so it allows the user to create whatever they want. I will also keep in mind to use flex-grow for creating space as opposed to using padding/margin. A lot of the time, you simply want an element to take up the available space.

### Useful resources
